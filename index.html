                    exploring caves, farming and even slaying mobs. However, i hate
                    building so much, it's because I'am very bad at design and

                    I'am a very chill Minecraft player, so that i did'nt get
                    angry easily even if i got trolled with my own friends. Also,
                    I likes to help others as quickly as i could everytime
                    when they are needed something, especially if they are
                    needed some materials or items.

                    On weekdays, I spent 2 hours each day by playing Minecraft.
                    While on the weekends, I always spent around 4-5 hours each day.
                    I like to play this game on Survival Mode, it's because there
                    are so many challenges on this mode and that makes me possible
                    to playing this game much longer, especially when i playing on this
                    mode with my friends.
